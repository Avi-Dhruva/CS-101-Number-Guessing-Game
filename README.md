#Number-Guessing-Game
The "Guess the Number" game is a simple guessing game in which the participant attempts to guess a secret number created at random.  The code is constructed to hold a secret number between 1-100. The user will attempt to guess the number. The participant inputs their guess, and the game tells them if it is correct and if not it says “Wrong guess”+ number of attempts not used, + “attempts left”. The game will continue until the player correctly guesses the number or achieves the maximum number of attempts. If they correctly guess the correct number the screen will say: “ Congratulations! You guessed the number in” + number of attempts + “attempts”. The site also displays a getting warmer or colder feature.
